          My journey in web development has been driven by a love for problem-solving and a commitment to continuous learning.
            Changing a raw idea into a website or a
            product that impacts lives. I want to do work that challenges me as
            a developer & work that I can be proud of.
            <br />
            <br />I am fluent in <b>Java and JavaScript</b> and know a bit of{" "}
            <b>Python</b> and am working on a few projects in the <b>MERN</b>{" "}
            stack.
            <br />I plan to learn <b>Next.js</b>, <b>Three.js</b>, and{" "}
            <b>TypeScript</b> in the near future. <br />
            <br />
